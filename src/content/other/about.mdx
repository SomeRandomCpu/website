Hi, I'm Duplicake. My real name is Magnus and I'm a young programmer.
I like: Google Pixels, Programming, Firefox, Selfhosting, Obsidian, Steam, Bluesky, and Linux (Fedora on my main, Debian on my server, and Arch on my low spec computer).
I dislike: Skids, Apple, Windows, Google (to some extent), and X (especially).

I know: A lot of programming languages (this site will be remade with something I make by myself instead of a template soon, so not listing them).

It isn't in my socials but I have 2 unused accounts. The one on Twitter: https://x.com/malwarebytes95 and the one on Mastodon: https://mastodon.social/@duplicake.
The contributions you see on my github are barely any because I do most of my development on a self hosted forgejo instance.
