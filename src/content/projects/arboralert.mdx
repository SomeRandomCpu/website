ArborAlert! is an open source discord bot that tracks notifies you to do your homework by scraping the Arbor website with selenium.

I decided to make it after I forgot to do my homework and my friends told me they had the same issue.
It's currently exclusive to my school's discord server, but I'm planning to make it public (and open source it) soon.

## Features

- Fast 
- Written in Python
- Stores credentials in an encrypted database
- Easy to use - even a 10 year old (starting secondary school) can use it
