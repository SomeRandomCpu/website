This is my website's source code, built with astro. I don't see why you would use this code (since it only contains personal stuff) but it's licensed under MIT anyway.

It uses the spectre astro theme found here: https://github.com/louisescher/spectre

GitHub banned my first account because they thought it was 'hacked' but it wasn't. Luckily I still have access to the code, but it isn't public. In case that happens again, this repo is mirrored to a selfhosted forgejo instance so I have a backup.
